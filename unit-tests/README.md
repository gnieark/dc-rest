#Unit tests

Change the parameters at the beginning of test-API.php and use it in console mode

 php test-API.php

This will test all the API methods.
Use this tests only on a developpement platform of Dotclear.

These tests are for the developer (me). I'm tired of systematically retest everything as I progress in development. 
Incidentally, they also serve as an example on the use of the API.
